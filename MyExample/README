This is a very simple example for beginners.

In any DD4hep base program we need atleast following
1) A compact xml file (containing just minimum description of the detector)
2) A Detector constructor code (THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE) , that can be  a
   C++ (more description, little bit more technical) or
    Python base (more readable)

In this example we will just try to create a simple compact xml file
contains just a  box description placed at origin.

The Detector construct will read this xml and create an in-memory generic detector
description model, which can be used later on for Simulation, Reconstruction,
 Analysis, and Visualization.
 
 Steps to compile this example
 1) Create a build directory
    mkdir build 
    cd build
 2) Now run following cmake command
    cmake ..
 3) Now compile it using make
    make 
    
 This will create a various subdirectories like bin, lib.
 
 For visualization of created geometry set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 from within the build directory it can be set as
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:lib
 
 Now one can visualize the geometry using geoDisplay with following command
 geoDisplay -compact test.xml
 
 This is the minimal example that will just create a hollow tube
