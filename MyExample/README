This is a very simple example for beginners.

In any DD4hep base program we need atleast following
1) A compact xml file (containing just minimum description of the detector)
2) A Detector constructor code (THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE) , that can be  a
   C++ (more description, little bit more technical) or
    Python base (more readable)

In this example we will just try to create a simple compact xml file
contains just a  box description placed at origin.

The Detector construct will read this xml and create an in-memory generic detector
description model, which can be used later on for Simulation, Reconstruction,
 Analysis, and Visualization.
